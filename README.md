# creabot
This is an extensible bot written in Node.js.

Currently the bot can do the following:
  * Play Cards Against Humanity
  * Play Countdown
  * Retrieve and display realtime information from the Dublin Bus website

The bot is extensible through the use of plugins. This is achieved using the plug library.

More information on writing plugins for the bot can be found in the plugins directory
